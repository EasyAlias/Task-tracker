# Task-tracker
Hi! = ) 

Would like to share my impressions related to the implementation of this project To-Do List (project m2) of my training and show my mistakes how not to do it.

Description:

This was an individual project that would fully comply with the technical task and used HTML+CSS+JS technologies. Deadline of the bull project was delivered 14 days after the technical task was issued.

Accomplishment:

There were some difficulties in performing the task, but they were all solved with the help of accumulated knowledge, recorded lectures, presentations, and of course the help of my teachers.

The most difficult thing was to apply the implementation of Drag-n-drop, since this material was allocated for independent training.

Everything went well and in order. But I made a big mistake. I only saved my changes to a local copy and didn't use GitHub. This led to sad consequences. When starting a new project, I forgot to change the folder in VS Code and started a new project in the current one. Made irreversible changes (deleted) the to-Do List code. When I realized this, I was very upset. But there was no way to fix it, so I started all over again until 7 days before the scheduled Deadline.

I found the strength and managed to complete this project on time.

Despite my mistakes, I now make every change on GitHub.

I also ask you to learn from my mistakes and save all your projects on GitHub

Thanks!
